# PyDMFT
#+AUTHOR: Óscar Nájera

A python library to work on quantum interacting systems. It is focused for
research using the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT)[dmft-rmp](#dmft-rmp)

This library was developed during my Doctoral research stay at the
[Laboratoire de Physique des solides in Orsay, France](https://www.lps.u-psud.fr/?lang=fr).

The particular highlight of this library is the gallery of examples for
which I have developed the scripts to reproduce known results in this field
and also provide with my personal research work, showing how it was done
and referencing the publication it appeared.
